LOCALLY
=======

* make two machines and test locally.
* play with rsync and it's options
rsync -r -z -a -h --delete --quiet -e ssh /etc root@192.168.99.101:/var/backup
rsync -r -z -a -h --delete --quiet -e ssh /etc ss@192.168.99.101:/var/backup
* used options: 
    1. `-v` for verbose
    2. `-a` for archive, preserves the permission, ownership, timestamps, files
    4. `-h` for human readable
    5. `--delete` for deleting file deleted on the host
    6. `-z` for compressing the files

ON PRODUCTION
=====
* try running `rsync -r -z -a -h --delete --quiet -e ssh $SOURCE s25723@dubhe.fmi.fail:~` It fails because I don't know the password
* Generate a key on charlie
```
ssh-keygen
```
* Add the keys from dubhe to charlie
* Add the keys from charlie to dubhe
* Establish ssh both ways via a keys because I don't know the password for my account on dubhe
* The rsync command works
* create /etc/cron.daily/backup
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    USER=s25723
    HOST=dubhe.fmi.fail
    SOURCE=/etc 
    DESTINATION=/home/s25723

    rsync -r -z -a -h --delete --quiet -e ssh $SOURCE $USER@$HOST:$DESTINATION
    ```
* make executable
    ```
    chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/backup
    ```
