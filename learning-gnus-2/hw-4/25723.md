```

## Install the kernel modules:

# Take 2 - tried using the make tinyconfig
====
Compiled a third kernel but could not make it interactive just a blank screen
Could not run unavailable

```
module scsi t-0x00 not found in modules dep
```
Tried adding some of the modules back but was not successful always got to initramfs stage due to lack of some modules


# Take 4 - tried removing previuos kernel by only deleting them from the /boot directory

* some data was left even afterr running make mrporper
* / root was cluttered 

# Take 5 - tried to remove more modules by hand

* start removing:
    - x86 package thermal driver
    - sound drivers
    - wlan drivers
    - filesystem 
* install kernel and boot
* booted successfully

Key takeaways:

I was doing the exercise on a mac from a VirtualBox and could not take advantage of -j option so I could not iterate faster

Did not have much time to play more ;/
