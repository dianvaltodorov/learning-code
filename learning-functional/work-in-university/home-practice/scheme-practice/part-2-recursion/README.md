Part 2:

Problems:
---
 * define the predicate (automorphic x) that tells if a number is automorphic
 * define the function (contains-digits? a b) that tells if a contains all the digits of b
 * define the function (digit-at-pos x position) that returns a digit at a specified position
 * define the function (define (double-factorial-rec n) and (double-factorial-iter n) that computes double factorial from n
 * define the function (define (factorial-rec n) and (factorial-iter n) that computes factorial from n
 * define the function (fast-exponent a n) that implements Exponentiation by squaring
 * define the function (sum-divisors x) that calculates the sum of the divisors of a x
 * define the predicate (is-perfect? x) that checks if x is prefect( equal to the sum of its divisors)
 * define the function (occurrences a x) that counts the occurrences of the digit x in the number a
 * define the predicate (increasing? x) to check if the digits of x are in an increasing order. For example 12345 returns true;
