# Setup a xmpp server

Task: configure an xmpp server and send velin a message.


# Run a local xmpp server 1

Before meeting my other team members try to host a local jabberd2
server on my VMs.

## DNS

Configure a simple dns server. Not much thought about
naming zones, just wanted quick, dirty and working env.

/etc/bind/named.conf.options

```config
acl "trusted" {
   192.168.56.101;    # ns1 - can be set to localhost
   192.168.56.102;    # ns2
   192.168.56.103;    # host1
   192.168.56.104;    # host2
};

options {
    directory "/var/cache/bind";

    recursion yes;
    allow-recursion { trusted; };
    listen-on { 192.168.56.101; };     # ns2 private IP address
    allow-transfer { none; };          # disable zone transfers by default

    forwarders {
            8.8.8.8;
            8.8.4.4;
    };
.....
```

ns1 /etc/bind/named.conf.local

```conig
zone "nyc3.example.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/zones/db.nyc3.example.com"; # zone file path
    allow-transfer { 192.168.56.102; };         # ns2 private IP address - secondary
};
```

```config
zone "nyc3.example.com" {
    type slave;
    file "db.nyc3.example.com";
    masters { 192.168.56.101; };  # ns1 private IP
};
```

```config
;
; BIND data file for local loopback interface
;
$TTL    604800
@   IN  SOA ns1.nyc3.example.com. admin.nyc3.example.com. (
                  3     ; Serial
             604800     ; Refresh
              86400     ; Retry
            2419200     ; Expire
             604800 )   ; Negative Cache TTL

; name servers - NS records
    IN      NS      ns1.nyc3.example.com.
    IN      NS      ns2.nyc3.example.com.

; name servers - A records
ns1.nyc3.example.com.          IN      A       192.168.56.101
ns2.nyc3.example.com.          IN      A       192.168.56.102
```

Add inside my linux /etc/resolv.conf:

```conf
search nyc3.example.com
nameserver 192.168.56.101
nameserver 192.168.56.102
nameserver 62.44.101.1
```

Troubleshoot from my Linux for the dns

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ns1.nyc3.example.com.	604800	IN	A	192.168.56.101


## Install jabberd2

On machine ns1 with ip 192.168.56.101 set up the jabberd2

* add sid to the source lists
* remove systemd constraints in /etc/apt/preferences.d/no-systemd wich do not
  allow installation of dh-systemd
* apt-get install jabberd2

## Install mysql-server

```bash
apt-get sintall mysql-server
```

## Set up the jabberd server

* Set Host Name (sm.xml and c2s.xml) to `ns1.nyc3.example.com`
* Provision and Configure mysql for Storage and Authentication Package(s)


## Connect

Install pidjon, gajim and profanity on my linux machine which has an ip
`192.168.56.1`. Try to connect with pidjon and gajim by but receive a hang
saying that it is connecting. Verify the ports and the dns

## Investigate logs

Look inside the /var/log/jabberd/ files and see that there is only a single
log in /var/log/jabberd2/router.log

Sat Jan 28 13:26:18 2017 [notice] [192.168.56.1, port=48935] connect

Conclusion:

The dns is working since I am hitting the correct machine. However something is
wrong with the configurarion.

## Set up berkley db

Install berkley db from source and set it up for
Authentication and Storage but nothing happens again. The same problem.

## Kind of run out of ideas

.... :(

## Looked up if all of the processes are running

c2s is not running


```bash
$ ps aux | grep jabber
root      8525  0.0  0.4  53028  4980 ?        S    14:47   0:00 /usr/sbin/jabberd2-router -c /etc/jabberd2/router.xml
root      8530  0.0  0.5 106140  5948 ?        S    14:47   0:00 /usr/sbin/jabberd2-sm -c /etc/jabberd2/sm.xml
root      8535  0.0  0.4  49028  4144 ?        S    14:47   0:00 /usr/sbin/jabberd2-s2s -c /etc/jabberd2/s2s.xml
```

## Reinstall from source to enable debug

Wanted to look up the debug options

```
apt-get remove --purge jabberd2
apt-get source jabberd2
apt-get build-deps jabberd2
autoreconf --install
./configure --enable-db --enable-ssl --enable-mysql --enable-debug
make
make install
```

Modify the config files

Did not help a lot


Install gajim and create a new account then try to connect:

```
$ gajim -v 
28/01/17 20:17:29 (D) nbxmpp.simplexml DEPTH -> 3 , tag -> register
28/01/17 20:17:29 (D) nbxmpp.simplexml DEPTH -> 2 , tag -> stream:features

28/01/17 20:17:29 (D) gajim.c.connection Connection to next host
28/01/17 20:17:29 (D) gajim.c.connection Out of hosts, giving up connecting to charlie.gnus.fccf.net

28/01/17 20:17:59 (D) gajim.plugin_system PluginInstallerPlugin.check_update() <entered>
```

These lines seem important. Try to turn off encryption but could not find the options in gajim

```bash
28/01/17 20:17:29 (I) nbxmpp.client_nb While connecting with type = "tls": TLS unsupported by remote server
28/01/17 20:17:29 (I) gajim.c.connection Connecting to next type beacuse desired is tls and returned is plain
```

Succeed login with pidjon and with profanity.

Chat between to accounts:

Profanity client with wido@ns1.nyc3.example.com
```
rido@ns1.nyc3.example.com [unencrypted]                                                                                                [ ...online ]

```

Pidgon client with rido@ns1.nyc3.example.com
```

```


## Add encryption in my enviroment by self signing a certificate

Since I can not connect to charlie mess around with encryption on my VMs

Self sign a certificate in order

```
openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:1024 -days 3650 -keyout privkey.pem -out server.pem
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out privkey.pem
cat privkey.pem >> server.pem
rm privkey.pem
mv server.pem /usr/local/etc/server.pem
chown root:jabber /usr/local/jabberd/server.pem    
chmod 640 /usr/local/jabberd/server.pem
```

Edit the c2s.xml by uncommenting

```
<pemfile>/usr/local/etc/server.pem</pemfile>
```

Edit the sm.xml by adding a pemfile attribute in <id>
```
    <id pemfile='/usr/local/etc/server.pem'
        register-enable='mu'>ns1.nyc3.example.com</id>
```

Connect using gajim to my server and get an error that I am not signed by an
official signing ceritficate. Aks me if I accept the certificate. Again the chat
works.

# Work on charlie 1

Install from source the same way we learnend as in hw5. Configured everything as
above using mysql. Reached a point where users are created but do not connect.
Same problem with tls and encryption. Connect via pidgion without encryption.
Try to message velin@ludost.ent.

Logs print. However dns lookup do not work

S2S : Sun Jan 29 13:47:05 2017 out.c:858 dns failure for ludost.net@0x254$8b0: SRV xmpp-server (-1)

## Rado , Miro connects to charlie.gnus.fccf.net! Success


## Rado managed to start another jabberd server

We are able to message from accounts on the same machine. For example
foo@oscar.gnus.fccf.net can chat with bar@oscar.gnus.fccf.net but on the other
hand bar@oscar.gnus.fccf.net can not chat with yolo@charlie.gnus.fccf.net


## Configure the srv dns records
Read that it is neceassary to configure the srv record.

Miro added some lines as he is the owner of yankee.
Something weird started happening in the log file:

```bash

## Get a certificate from let's encryption

Generate a standalone from certbot and include it
```
apt-get install certbot
certbot cert-only
```
