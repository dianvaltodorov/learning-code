* Went to work and compiled the kernel with the config produced from `make oldconfig`:

Installed deps and cloned:
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev gcc make git exuberant-ctags bc libssl-dev`
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
```

Open the dir I cloned into and run:
```
make oldconfig
make
make modules
sudo make modules_install install
sudo update-grub2
```

After this booted and opened the grub2. Saw my new kernel listed adn as it turned out it is now the
default one. So I ended up with a machine with kernel 4.9.0-rc6+

* Found out how to default kernel `/etc/default/grub` and set it to my older kernel by default
* Build tinier config. Used command `make tinyconfig`
* Run the `make -j4` to make compilation faster
* Tried running `make modules` and make `modules_install` but the output is that the present kernel
  configuration has modules disabled.
* Run `make install` and got that I have no modules for this configuration and that kernel headers
  are missing:

* Tried installing the package `sudo apt-get install linux-headers-4.9.0-rc6` but the package was
  not found. Did not know why actually
* Rebooted and it seems to work
* Ended up installing not a stable version however. But it is not a problem
