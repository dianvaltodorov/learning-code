* Took banshee.ova image and copied to banshee.ova to server.ova and victim.ova
* Started two new vms from the two images.
* Checked their MAC address with the command `ifconfig -a` and both gave the same output:
```
Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 08:00:27:3a:f4:34
....
```
* Found tutorial on how to clone a VM inside virtualbox which showed how to take care of the Network
  devices by checking a box. Deleted old vms and made new ones with different MACs and IPs.
* Remove the disk on VICTIM and tried to start it but that showed 'Could not read from the boot medium. System halted'

export WORKDIR="/home/student"
mkdir -p $WORK/srv/tftp $WORK/srv/nfsroot
export NFSROOT="$WORKDIR/srv/nfsroot"
debootstrap stable $NFSROOT 
```

* Install packages in the NFS installation
```
chroot $NFSROOT apt-get update
chroot $NFSROOT apt-get install initramfs-tools linux-image-2.6.32-5-amd64
```

* Configure its initramfs to generate NFS-booting initrdâ€™s
```
sed 's/BOOT=local/BOOT=nfs/' -i $NFSROOT/etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
